regressively. Not only business but the entire world got affected due to its it’s sudden walkthrough. The WHO was declared a health emergency on 30th Jan 2020 throughout 
the globe. 

In this crisis, Many trending tools and methods like App development, algorithm design in ML to get the number of cases in covid-19 cases, use of AI methods etc. helped 
as a long period technology and Innovation in IT played a vital role by inculcating things at a normal pace. Information Technology helped in imparting the total number 
of cases with proper statistics with the help of data science. In a densely populated country like India, it is very difficult to prevent the community transmission even 
during lockdown without social awareness and precautionary measures taken by the people.

Recently, several containment zones had been identified throughout the world specially in a high populated country like India and divided into red, orange and green 
zones, respectively. So, The red zones indicate the infection hotspots, orange zones denote some infection and green zones indicate an area with no infection. 

This project mainly focuses on development of an Android application which can inform people about the number of increasing in total tested, active, recovered, and death 
cases. This Android application updates the numbers of cases in all countries on a daily basis. So, anyone can get the numbers in one place in a single Scroll view and 
can get help with these data. To achieve all these functionalities, many tools, and APIs from Google like Retrofit and RESTful API are used in this application. 
Therefore, this application can be used as a tool for creating further social awareness about the arising need of precautionary measures to be taken by the people of the 
whole world.
